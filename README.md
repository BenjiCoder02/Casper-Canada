# Casper Canada Product Page

## This project is for the Casper Canada front end development assessment
## It was bootstrapped with Node V19.8.1

## The approach


I decided to prioritize the main section which showcases the product and the ability to add the product to the cart.So in the event the design could not be implemented in time in a real world scenario, a product owner could still decide to publish the product since the bare essentials were delivered.
I also tried to split each part of the page as a component so it could be reused elsewhere and is purely decoupled from the rest of the page structure.

It uses the following technologies
## For the implementation
0. React. React offers an amazing library to build scalable interfaces that can be split into components and allows developers to drag and drop functionality where it's needed with minimal changes. 
## For seo
1. React-helmet for seo related functionality. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet)
## For Translations
2. react-18next i18next (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-i18next)
## For dynamic classnames
3. (clsx https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx)

Features that could not be delivered in time
1. The mobile slider for the main product image.
2. The slider at the top in blue.
3. The ratings and testimonials section.


To run the project just use `npm start`
The project was created with Node V19. In case you have isses with installation or run. Try to use this version of Node.

#Architecture
The page is split into multiple components.
This makes it easier to move things around as needed and resuse where applicable.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
